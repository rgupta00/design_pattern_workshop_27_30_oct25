/*
 * Memento Design Pattern — Simple Definition:
	It saves an object’s state at a moment in time so you can restore it later — 
	like an undo button — without exposing the object’s internal details.


	=> Memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object 
	so that we can restore later on. Memento pattern is used to implement
	 this in such a way that the saved state data of the object is not accessible outside of the object, 
	this protects the integrity of saved state data.


	=> Example text editors where we can save it’s data anytime and 
	use undo to restore it to previous saved state
